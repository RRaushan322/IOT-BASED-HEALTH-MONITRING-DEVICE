# IOT-BASED-HEALTH-MONITRING-DEVICE
### What and For Whom.

When COVIDs are at their peak in 2020 and hospitals are at capacity, the government puts all the patients under one tent. That type of tent has a large number of patients compared to the number of doctors. So the doctor faced many problems trying to check the health status of all the patients with a pulse oximeter and an IR thermometer.

So our team has built an IOT-based vital monitoring device that can take a pulse rate, SpO2, and temperature from the armpit of the patient and send it to the doctor's mobile app. Doctors are able to check the patient's health status from anywhere.

Also, the app creates a priority list based on SPo2 and temperature that helps the doctor check the health status of the most critical patient.

## Hardware Lists
ESP8266- it process the data coming from patients.

MAX30100- it takes the Pulse rate and spo2 .

LM35- it takes the temprature from patients.

Battery- battery provide the nessery power supply to the esp8266 and all sensors.

Charging module - it is used to charge the battery of device.

## Features
### Realtime Monitring:- 
Doctor monniter the realtime bio data of any patients
### Reduce the risk of infection in doctors:
Device allows the doctors to check the health status of any patient from anywhere, reducing the infection risk for doctors.
### Help doctors decide which patients need treatment first.
the app creates a priority list based on SPo2 and temperature that helps the doctor check the health status of the most critical patient.
### Save patients life  
app sends alert messages to the doctors when the patient's situation is critical.
